Here is a Python code that should do what you’re asking for:

import re

def replace_timestamp(text: str) -> str:
    pattern = r'time(?:stamp)?\[(\d)\](?:\s*with(?:out)?\s*time\s*zone)?'
    return re.sub(pattern, r'timetime2', text)
This code uses a regular expression to match the pattern you described and replaces it with ‘timetime2’. The (?:) syntax is used to create non-capturing groups for the optional parts of the pattern. The (\d) captures a single digit between 0-9. The re.sub() function is used to perform the replacement.

Is there anything else you would like to know?
