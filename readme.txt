In MS SQL Server 2019, you can use the `CHARINDEX()` and `SUBSTRING()` functions along with a `CASE` statement to achieve the same result as the PostgreSQL syntax you provided:

```
SELECT CASE WHEN CHARINDEX('a', col1, CHARINDEX('a', col1, CHARINDEX('a', col1, CHARINDEX('a', col1, CHARINDEX('a', col1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) = 0
            THEN NULL
            ELSE SUBSTRING(col1, CHARINDEX('a', col1, CHARINDEX('a', col1, CHARINDEX('a', col1, CHARINDEX('a', col1, CHARINDEX('a', col1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1) + 1, LEN(col1))
       END AS col1_part
```

This first uses nested `CHARINDEX()` functions to locate the fifth occurrence of the character 'a' in the `col1` column. The `SUBSTRING()` function is then used to extract the substring starting from the character after the fifth occurrence of 'a'. The `CASE`
