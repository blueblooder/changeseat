Certainly! You can use the `datetime` module in Python to achieve this. Here's an example code that waits until 11:50 AM and then proceeds with the remaining code:

```python
import datetime
import time

target_time = datetime.time(11, 50)  # Set the target time to 11:50 AM

while True:
    current_time = datetime.datetime.now().time()  # Get the current time
    if current_time >= target_time:
        break  # Exit the loop if the current time is equal to or greater than the target time
    else:
        time.sleep(1)  # Wait for 1 second before checking the time again

# Proceed with the remaining code here
print("It's 11:50 AM. Proceeding with the remaining code...")
# Rest of your code goes here
```

In this code, we set the `target_time` variable to 11:50 AM using the `datetime.time` function. Then, we enter a loop where we continuously check the current time using `datetime.datetime.now().time()`. If the current time is equal to or greater than the target time, we break out of the loop and proceed with the remaining code. Otherwise, we use `time.sleep(1)` to pause the execution for 1 second before checking the time again.

Note that this code will continuously run until the target time is reached. If you want to run this code as part of a script, make sure to run it in a separate thread or process to avoid blocking the main execution.
