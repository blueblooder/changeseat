Apologies for the misunderstanding. To exclude individual lines within the `logfield` that contain the word "Carte" in MSSQL 2019, you can use the `CROSS APPLY` operator with a string splitting function and the `NOT LIKE` operator. Here's an example SQL query:

```sql
SELECT logfield
FROM log
CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT(logfield, CHAR(10)) AS lines
WHERE lines.value NOT LIKE '%Carte%'
GROUP BY logfield
HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM STRING_SPLIT(logfield, CHAR(10)))
```

In this query:

1. The `CROSS APPLY` operator is used with the `STRING_SPLIT` function to split the `logfield` into individual lines. The `CHAR(10)` represents the line break character.

2. The `WHERE` clause filters out the lines that contain the word "Carte" using the `NOT LIKE` operator.

3. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by the `logfield`.

4. The `HAVING` clause ensures that only the `logfield` values containing all the original lines are selected. It does this by comparing the count of lines after filtering with the count of lines in the original `logfield`.

By using this approach, only the `logfield` values that include all lines without the word "Carte" will be returned.
